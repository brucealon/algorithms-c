This is just for playing around. It's been years since I did anything
with algorithms, and I almost forgot how much I enjoy C. So I'm
experimenting with both.

I took the data files from the download available for Algorithms,
Fourth Edition, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. It's a book I've
been enjoying quite a lot.
